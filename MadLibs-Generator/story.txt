One day, I decided to visit the zoo. It was a/an <adjective> day, and the sun was <verb ending in -ing> in the <noun>. As soon as I arrived, I saw a/an <adjective> <animal> <verb ending in -ing> near the entrance.

I bought a ticket and walked inside. The first exhibit I visited was the <adjective> <animal> exhibit. The <animal> was <verb ending in -ing> and looked very <adjective>.

Next, I went to see the <plural noun>. They were <verb ending in -ing> around and playing with a <noun>. One of them even <past tense verb> on my <body part>! It was so <adjective>.

After that, I decided to get some lunch. I went to the zoo caf√© and ordered a/an <food>. It was <adjective> and very <adjective>.

Finally, I ended my day by visiting the <adjective> <animal> exhibit. The <animal> was <verb ending in -ing> and made a/an <adjective> sound. It was the perfect way to end my <adjective> day at the zoo.

I can't wait to visit again and see more <plural noun>!
